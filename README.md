The following is a sample of products created during the *"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"* course.

## Project 01

In the `project-01/` folder you can find my exploration of the World Cup matches. In it, I examine the attendance over time for the World Cup and for the final matches, I analyzed which side of the field tended to have more wins and the type of win: normal, extra time, or penalty shootout.

**Attendance data visualization:**

## Project 02

In this project, I explored the 2017 Boston Marathon Finishers dataset. I focused on finishers from Florida. Visualizations were created for the number of finishers per county, a comparison between genders for the overall rank, and a linear model for age vs official time achieved. Find the code and report in the `project-02/` folder.

**County finishers data visualization:**

## Project 03

In this project, I explored reproducing various visualizations given to me, with data about the climate at the Tampa International Airport in 2022 and concrete strength from the UCI Machine Learning repository. Some of the graphs I had to reproduce were density plots, scatter plots, and box plots.

**Concrete data visualization:**

### Moving Forward

Through my projects, I have learned how to make better data visualizations by properly using things such as the layout, formatting, and colors used. I have also learned how to make my work reproducible by following good practices and using version control. Now, I can make a decent visualization and analyze it, but I cannot really tell a story with it, so moving forward, I would like to get better at data storytelling.
